# nodemcu-thermistor
NodeMCU thermistor module for the ESP8266.

## Directions
You need to replace the information in the configuration file with the information provided by your thermistor's manufacturer.  If you only have a Beta value (minimum requirement), you may only specify that in the configuration file, and disregard the rest.
